nRF5 SDK for Thread v0.8.0
------------------------
Release Date: Week 10, 2017
  
This release is an experimental release and should only be used to explore 
and try out the Thread features available on the nRF52840 chip.

Highlights:
- Pre-built OpenThread stack: https://github.com/openthread/openthread
- An example which demonstrates a minimal OpenThread application that 
  enables user interaction through built-in CLI
- Examples presenting interactions between different Thread roles: 
  Full Thread Device (Thread Router/REED), 
  Minimal Thread Device(Minimal End Device/Sleepy End Device),
  using OpenThread's built-in CoAP protocol
- An example which demonstrates how to run a secure Device Firmware Update 
  (DFU) process over a Thread network
- Demo Thread Border Router
- wpantund (Wireless Network Interface Daemon for Low-Power Wireless SoCs) 
  used as part of the Demo Thread Border Router solution: 
  https://github.com/openthread/wpantund
- A Network Co-Processor(NCP) application - nRF52840 serves as a connectivity
  chip and communicates with wpantund present on the application processor
- An example demonstrating interaction between nodes running OpenThread and 
  a remote cloud service through the Demo Thread Border Router
- An example demonstrating Thread native commissioning via NFC with use of 
  OpenThread and Demo Thread Border Router
- Thread Topology Monitor PC tool
- Software components and application examples for MDK, peripherals, 
  and NFC inherited from nRF5 SDK v.13.0.0
